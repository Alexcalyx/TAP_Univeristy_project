**Summary:**

This code helps manage a university entrance exam for different types of applicants, like those in Science or Humanities. It has classes to represent applicants and the exam, and a class to handle the user interface. The exam class takes care of adding or deleting subjects, and counting how many students pass the exam. The user interface class allows users to update the passing score and marks, enter applicant details, and see the results. The code also listens for button clicks to perform these tasks. The code is like a helper that makes sure everything works smoothly when people use the entrance exam website.
