LMAO University Entrance Examination - Project Documentation

Introduction:

The LMAO University Entrance Examination is a web application that helps students determine if they pass the entrance exam for LMAO University. The exam follows a two-stage selection process, and each applicant needs to achieve a certain passing score to be eligible for admission. The passing score is set to 350, which means the total score of an applicant should be equal to or greater than 350 to pass the exam.

Functionalities:

Number of Applicants: The application allows the user to enter the number of applicants who are taking the entrance exam. The user must input a number between 1 and 1000.

Applicant Scores: After entering the number of applicants, the user can provide the scores for each applicant in different subjects. The subjects are English, Mathematics, Science, Japanese, and Geography. The scores should be between 0 and 100 for each subject.

Passing Score: The passing score of 350 is displayed on the top-right of the web page. This is the minimum total score required for an applicant to pass the entrance exam.

Science and Humanities Applicants: The entrance exam considers two types of applicants: Science and Humanities. Science applicants must obtain a minimum total score of 160 in Mathematics and Science subjects. Humanities applicants must obtain a minimum total score of 160 in Japanese and Geography subjects.

Add and Delete Subjects: The user can add new subjects or delete existing ones from the list of subjects. This allows flexibility in tailoring the exam based on different subjects offered by LMAO University.

Changing Passing Score: The user can update the passing score dynamically. By default, it is set to 350, but the user can change it to any value between 1 and 1000.

Working Principle:

The user starts by entering the number of applicants for the entrance exam and submits the form.

After submitting, the user is prompted to enter the scores for each applicant in different subjects. The user can also select the applicant type as Science or Humanities.

Once the user provides the scores, the application calculates the total score for each applicant and checks if they pass the two-stage selection process.

The application displays the number of applicants who have passed the entrance exam based on the passing score and the specific requirements for Science and Humanities applicants.

The user can also add new subjects or delete existing subjects from the list. The application dynamically updates the list of subjects for all applicants.

The user can change the passing score, and the application reflects the updated passing score in the result.

The application is flexible, allowing the user to customize the subjects and passing score. It ensures fair selection of applicants based on their scores and the specific requirements for Science and Humanities applicants.
